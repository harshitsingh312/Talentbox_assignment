1. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and perform well with small datasets. Also SVMs can model non-linear decision boundaries with high accuracy.
2. Tuning parameters of SVM are its Kernel, regularization parameter, Gamma value and decided Margin width.
3. Other choices of classification algorithms used were RandomForestClassifier and the GaussianNaiveBayes Classifier. Accuracy received from GaussianNB was decent and from RandomForest was comparable to the SVM.
4. SVM gave an accuracy value of 87.8%
5. Metrics used for model evaluation were Accuracy score and Confusion matrix.
